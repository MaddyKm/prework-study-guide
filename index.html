          <li>HTML tag brackets all the codes</li>
          <li> Title or heading/ bigger text use tag h1 through h6 </li>
          <li>Unordered list use UL with LI inside for list items</li>
          <li>Breaks to add a line in space use br</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>Defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout and organization</li>
          <li>3 Types of adding in CSS to html</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Inline CSS: written with html, uses a style attribute. This is quick but a more permanent fix and makes editing harder</li>
              <li>Internal Style Sheet: embedded using style element in the head element and contains the rules for the full page</li>
              <li>External CSS Style Sheet: Most common, keeps rules in a separate file, linked using a link element placed in the HTML head element  </li> 
            </ul>
          <li>Sheet is added to assets file </li>
          <li>Selector: defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations: contain the CSS property and the value of that property </li>
            <ul>
              <li>e.g. color: blue</li>
              <li>Color is the property, blue is the value</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. When a Margin = 0 we want no extra space </li>
          <li>Padding property adds space around the content inside an element. Increasing padding makes an element bigger</li>
          <li>See CSS box model</li>
          <li>* selector applies the rules to all the elements on the page</li>
          <li>Use different selectors (section, ul, etc) to honr in on specific pieces</li>
          <li>Sizes are measured in px</li>
          <li>add code after meta via link using rel attribute to define the relationship and href to specify the location of the style sheet</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to shaare a css rule to any element we choose</li>
          <li>we added . card (period denotes class selector) in our stylesheet to create the border/ shadowbox around our sections</li>
          <li>Next we add class="card" in the section element to apply the css rules</li>
        </ul>
   
      </section>
   
      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git flow is super important to not make changes to the main code on the pages</li>
          <li>When editing always first check what branch you're in with 'git status'</li>
          <li>git checkout -b name: Creates a working branch for your project with whatever you name it</li>
          <li> Pushing to github 1. save file 2. git add -A 3. git commit -m "notes" 4. git push origin branchname  </li>
          <li> From there it will be pushed into your github and you can get reviews/ merge into the main branch</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Makes your page interactive</li>
          <li>Variables- a named container that allows you to store data in your code</li>
          <li>Declare a variable with 'var' keyword and give it a name after</li>
          <li>Control Flow is the order the code is executed, javascript is read top to bottom</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript is ended with a semicolon</li>
          <li>Find the Chrome DevTools in the browser, left click, inspect, console</li>
          <li>If statements: introduces decision making in our code, only is executed <i>if</i> the statement meets a condition or is true (if, else if, else)</li>
          <li>Arrray: a single variable used to hold a group of data that is usually related in someway</li>
          <li>Create an array by naming a variable inside straight brackets (You can store different types of data in an array)</li>
          <li>Strings are contained in quotes</li>
          <li>You can work on a single piece of an array, they are automatically given an order in which they are listed starting with 0 and moving up, use name[0]</li>
          <li>For loops, we use a predictable pattern to perform a task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>For loops contain:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Starting point for the loop(if you want the beginning you declare a variable x and git it a value of 0)</li>
            <li>Condition: as long as variable x is less than the length of the array the loop will run. Use the length built in array property (length property = # of variables in array). </li>
            <li>Final Statement allows the array to iterate over each time. x++ is a short cut to add 1 each time</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Functions define and reuse lines of code</li>
          <li> Must define function (use function keyword then name of function, below the function is contaned in curly brackets) then call function (functionname ())</li>
          <li>You can have a randomized selectuib with math function, use math.floor and math.random functions together</li>
